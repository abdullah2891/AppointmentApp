# AppointmentApp

This will be a very simple web application which handles appointments.
The appointments will be stored in a SQL database with at least 1 table. 
We recommend that one of the tables contains 2 columns: 
(1) a datetime column which records the appointment's time and (2) a description column.


To do: 
1) Adding search functionality
2) Forcing user to use correct Date format by using regex([/d\/d\/d] at the server side
3)Making the server code more readable and modular
and more
